## Welcome to Anahit's and Alexander's Monopoly!

This is a program written in Java, which using Java Swing, simulates Monopoly: Classic Edition. Here is a guideline to help you get started to play it properly.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains several folders, where:

- `src`: the folder with source code
- `images`: the folder with visuals

## Starting Screen

Click "Start". Selecet the number of players. Submit the names (don't repeat them!). The game starts.

## Main Window

Enjoy the game!

You can see the board on the left and the control panel on the right.

The active player's name is always bolded.

You can see your belongings lit up under the infopanel. You can click on them to perform various actions, including "Mortgage Property", "Lift Mortgage", "Erect House" and "Destroy House". The purposes of the buttons should be evident.

Click "Throw Dice" to roll dices. Click "Trade" to initialize a trade with a player. Click "Done" to pass the turn to the next player.

Click on any property on the board to get more info.
